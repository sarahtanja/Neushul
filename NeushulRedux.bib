	abstract = {Objectively defined, benthic plant associations in the Puget Sound region are compared with associations recorded by other workers, in this and other areas. A shallow Laminariaassociation,an Agarum dominatedregion at mid-depthsand a red algal association of Rhodoptilum, Callophyllis, and hydroids near the lower (17 to 20 m) limits of plant distribution, are described. Variation in community composition at similar depths is attributed mainly to substrate differences. Algal community structure is shown to be influenced by variation with season, depth and water movement. The descriptive details obtained in this study provide a basis for further inquiry into the environmental conditions that define these under-seaplant associations.},
